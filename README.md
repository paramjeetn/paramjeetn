## About

I design and build scalable software systems that combine AI with robust backend infrastructure. My focus is on **engineering depth over demos** — creating systems that are observable, testable, and built to last.

**Current focus areas:**
- Multi-agent AI systems and LLM orchestration
- Backend architecture and serverless infrastructure
- Developer tooling and automation
- AI evaluation, safety, and reliability
